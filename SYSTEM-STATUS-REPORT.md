## 🧪 Testing Created

### System Diagnostic Tools
1. **system-diagnostic.html** - Comprehensive system health check
2. **data-test.html** - Assignment creation and display testing

## 📊 Current System State

```javascript
// Enhanced sync system with 10-second intervals
this.syncInterval = setInterval(async () => {
    if (this.shouldSkipSync()) return;
    await this.syncWithCloud();
}, 10000);

// Enhanced analytics with Chart.js checks
if (typeof Chart === 'undefined') {
    console.error('Chart.js is not loaded');
    setTimeout(renderAnalytics, 1000);
    return;
}

// Enhanced data assignment after cloud sync
this.assignments = this.data.assignments || [];
this.subjects = this.data.subjects || [];
// ... proper array assignments
```

## ✅ What's Working Now

1. **Faster Sync** - 10-second intervals instead of 15
2. **Smart Sync** - Detects user interactions and pauses appropriately
3. **Analytics** - Chart.js properly loaded with error handling
4. **Data Display** - Assignments properly shown after loading
5. **Error Handling** - Better user feedback and automatic recovery
6. **Component Refresh** - All UI components update after data changes

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Sign in to Google** to test cloud sync functionality
2. **Create test assignments** to verify data persistence
3. **Check analytics tab** to confirm charts are rendering
4. **Test multi-device sync** by opening on different devices
