## 🔧 **Key Features Implemented**

### 1. **Immediate Sync on Every Change**

- **Assignment Deletion**: Syncs immediately when assignments are removed  
- **Master Data Changes**: Syncs immediately when departments, labs, subjects, faculty are modified
- **Automatic Triggers**: Every data modification triggers immediate cloud sync

### 2. **Enhanced Token Management**
```javascript
// Smart token handling with silent refresh
async getAccessToken(allowPopup = true) {
    // 1. Use cached token if valid
    // 2. Try silent refresh for background sync
    // 3. Request new token with popup only if needed
}
```

### 3. **Aggressive Real-Time Sync**
